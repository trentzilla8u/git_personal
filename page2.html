The Requirements sessions
</h2>
<p class="Requirements">
At the beginning, i was working as a backup consultant with another consulting firm that we were planning on acquiring later in the year. This was helpful, as i only needed to attend the meetings that i could make it to. However, when the acquisition fell through, i was left trying to play catchup on the sessions that i had missed.
